- Extract all constraints from coding patterns and development decisions
- Create definitive context document that implementers can rely on without follow-ups

**Output Location**: `/agents/phase_1/context_gatherer_phase1_output.md`

**Output Summary**:

3. Performance: Design tokens used? Debounced updates? Lazy loading?
4. Reliability: Error handling? Fallbacks? Input validation?
5. Maintainability: Pure functions? Clear naming? Type safety?
6. Standards Compliance: Follows patterns? API design? Component standards?

Categorize Issues:
🔴 MUST FIX - Blocking issues (implementation stops until fixed)
🟡 SHOULD FIX - Important improvements (should address before phase complete)
🟢 CONSIDER - Nice to have (can defer to later phases)

Output to: /agents/phase_1/code_reviewer_phase1_output.md
```

**Expected Output**: Comprehensive code review with categorized findings

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (Never Violate)

### From Development Decisions (`/ai_docs/development_decisions.md`):
1. **Authentication**: Google OAuth ONLY (no email/password)
2. **Database**: Supabase only
3. **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS only
4. **No Testing Code**: Puppeteer MCP playbooks only
5. **Payments**: NOT in Phase 1 (absolute last step of entire project)

### From Coding Patterns (`/ai_docs/coding_patterns.md`):
1. **Repository Pattern**: Pure functions with DI (NO classes)
2. **API Pattern**: Always use withAuth/withApiHandler wrappers
3. **Migration Pattern**: Create files only, apply with explicit user permission
4. **Design Tokens**: CSS variables only (NO hardcoded values)

### From Testing Standards (`/ai_docs/testing/README.md`):
1. **Visual Verification**: Mandatory for all UI components
2. **Screenshots**: Desktop (1440px) + Mobile (375px) required
3. **Playbooks**: Must execute and pass before phase complete
