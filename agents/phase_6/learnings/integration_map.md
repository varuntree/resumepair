**CRITICAL**: During phase development, migrations are created as files ONLY. They are NOT applied to the database until explicit user permission.

### ‚úÖ RLS Policy Completeness Checklist (Phase 6)

**For ALL user-scoped tables**, create these 4 CRUD policies:

```sql
-- Required RLS policies:
-- 1. SELECT: Read own data
CREATE POLICY "users_select_own" ON table_name
  FOR SELECT USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- 2. INSERT: Create own data
CREATE POLICY "users_insert_own" ON table_name
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- 3. UPDATE: Modify own data
CREATE POLICY "users_update_own" ON table_name
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (user_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- 4. DELETE: Remove own data
CREATE POLICY "users_delete_own" ON table_name
  FOR DELETE USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

**Critical**: Missing any of these 4 policies creates a security gap.
```

**Impact**: Prevents security gaps in user-scoped tables
**Dependencies**: Supabase RLS enabled

  keywordScore={22}
  contentScore={18}
  formatScore={14}
  completenessScore={9}
  showBreakdown={true}
  showSuggestions={true}
  theme="default"
  // 20+ more props...
/>

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Composed components
<ScoreDashboard score={overallScore}>
  <ScoreRing value={atsScore} max={30} label="ATS" />
  <ScoreRing value={keywordScore} max={25} label="Keywords" />
  <ScoreBreakdown dimensions={dimensions} />
  <ScoreSuggestions items={suggestions} />
</ScoreDashboard>
```

**New Content**:
```markdown
#### Domain-Specific Types (Phase 6)

**Rule**: Use granular types for domain values with business rules.

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Generic primitives
interface Score {
  dimensions: { [key: string]: number }
  total: number
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Explicit types with rules
interface ScoreDimensions {
  atsScore: number      // 0-30 points
  keywordScore: number  // 0-25 points
  contentScore: number  // 0-20 points
  formatScore: number   // 0-15 points
  completenessScore: number // 0-10 points
}

interface Score {
  dimensions: ScoreDimensions
  total: number // Sum of dimensions (0-100)
}
```

**Benefits**:
