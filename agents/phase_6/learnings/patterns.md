## Pattern 1: Simple Algorithms Beat Complex Solutions

**ID**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-001
**Category**: technical
**Type**: discovery
**Frequency**: 2 occurrences
**Confidence**: 0.95

### Description
When faced with performance requirements, simple algorithmic approaches (basic string operations, keyword matching) can meet or exceed performance budgets without complex dependencies or optimizations. In Phase 6, basic keyword matching achieved ~100ms performance, 5x faster than the 500ms budget.

### Evidence
Referenced observations:
- **Observation 1**: User explicitly requested simple algorithms instead of TF-IDF, NLP, ML approaches
- **Observation 2**: Simple keyword matching achieved 100ms (2x faster than 500ms budget)

### Impact Analysis
- **Time Saved**: 4+ hours (avoided complex implementation)
- **Components Affected**: `/libs/scoring/keyword-analysis.ts`, `/libs/scoring/ats-checks.ts`
- **Severity**: high
- **Blocking**: No

### Root Cause
Over-engineering tendency when seeing "performance requirement" without first measuring baseline simple approach. Developers often assume complex solutions are needed for strict performance budgets.

### Recommended Action
Add development decision: "Start with simple algorithms; optimize only when performance budgets are missed after measurement"

## Pattern 2: Design Token Violations After Previous Phase Lessons

**ID**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-002
**Category**: technical
**Type**: anti-pattern
**Frequency**: 2 occurrences
**Confidence**: 0.90

### Description
Despite Phase 5 lessons about design tokens, hardcoded colors (`bg-green-500`, `bg-gray-300`, `bg-green-100 text-green-800`) were still used in Phase 6 components. Pattern wasn't fully internalized.

### Evidence
Referenced observations:
- **Observation 3**: Hardcoded colors in ScoreBreakdown.tsx (`bg-green-500`, `bg-gray-300`)
- **Observation 4**: Hardcoded colors in KeywordAnalysis.tsx (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)

### Impact Analysis
- **Time Lost**: 1 hour (code review + fixes)
- **Components Affected**: `ScoreBreakdown.tsx`, `KeywordAnalysis.tsx`
- **Severity**: medium
- **Blocking**: No

### Root Cause
Lack of automated enforcement mechanism for design token compliance. Lessons documented but not systematically checked during development.

### Recommended Action
1. Add design token check to code review standards
2. Create reusable badge variants in shadcn config instead of custom color classes
3. Consider automated linting rule for hardcoded Tailwind colors

## Pattern 3: Incomplete RLS Policies in Initial Migrations

**ID**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-003
**Category**: technical
**Type**: problem
**Frequency**: 1 occurrence
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Description
Missing DELETE policy in initial migration (017_create_resume_scores.sql). Only SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE policies were created, leaving DELETE operation unprotected.

### Evidence
Referenced observations:
- **Observation 5**: Missing DELETE policy caught by code reviewer agent

### Impact Analysis
- **Time Lost**: 30 minutes (review + fix)
- **Components Affected**: `migrations/phase6/017_create_resume_scores.sql`
- **Severity**: high (security issue)
- **Blocking**: Yes (blocked merge until fixed)

### Root Cause
No systematic checklist for RLS policy completeness. Easy to forget one of the 4 CRUD operations when writing policies manually.

### Recommended Action
Create RLS policy checklist for any new user-scoped table:
```sql
-- Required policies:
- SELECT: USING (user_id = auth.uid())
- INSERT: WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid())
- UPDATE: USING + WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid())
- DELETE: USING (user_id = auth.uid())
```

## Pattern 4: User ID Denormalization for RLS Performance

**ID**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-004
**Category**: technical
**Type**: best_practice
**Frequency**: 1 occurrence
**Confidence**: 0.80

### Description
Store `user_id` directly in child tables (`resume_scores`) even though it exists in parent table (`resumes`). This denormalization enables efficient RLS without joins.

### Evidence
Referenced observations:
- **Observation 6**: User ID denormalization pattern applied in resume_scores table

### Impact Analysis
- **Time Saved**: Future query performance gains
- **Components Affected**: Database schema design
- **Severity**: medium
- **Blocking**: No

### Root Cause
RLS policies execute on every query. Joining to parent table for user_id check adds significant overhead. Direct user_id column eliminates join.

### Recommended Action
Add to development decisions: "Denormalize user_id in child tables for RLS performance"

## Pattern 5: Component Composition Over Configuration

**ID**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-005
**Category**: technical
**Type**: best_practice
**Frequency**: 3 occurrences
**Confidence**: 0.90

### Description
Small, focused components (ScoreRing, ScoreDashboard, ScoreBreakdown) with single responsibility are more maintainable than monolithic components with 20+ props.

### Evidence
Referenced observations:
- **Observation 7**: ScoreRing component (<50 lines, single purpose)
- **Observation 8**: ScoreDashboard component (<80 lines, composition)
- **Observation 9**: ScoreBreakdown component (<100 lines, focused)

### Impact Analysis
- **Time Saved**: Easier maintenance and debugging
- **Components Affected**: All scoring UI components
- **Severity**: medium
- **Blocking**: No

### Root Cause
Clear component boundaries make code easier to understand, test, and modify. Each component does one thing well.

### Recommended Action
Add component composition examples to coding_patterns.md for score-like features

## Pattern 6: apiError Parameter Order Consistency

**ID**: PAT-P6-PROCESS-001
**Category**: process
**Type**: success
**Frequency**: 1 occurrence (absence of errors)
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Description
Phase 5 lesson about `apiError(statusCode, message)` parameter order was successfully applied in Phase 6. No parameter order mistakes occurred.

### Evidence
Referenced observations:
- **Observation 10**: No parameter order errors in Phase 6 API routes

### Impact Analysis
- **Time Saved**: ~30 minutes (no debugging needed)
- **Components Affected**: API routes
- **Severity**: low
- **Blocking**: No

### Root Cause
Learning from Phase 5 was successfully transferred and internalized.

### Recommended Action
Validate that learning system is working - this is evidence of successful knowledge transfer.

## Pattern 7: Self-Fix Workflow for Small Issues

**ID**: PAT-P6-PROCESS-002
**Category**: process
**Type**: discovery
**Frequency**: 1 occurrence
**Confidence**: 0.75

### Description
Process: Implementer → Code Review → Fix Issues Myself → Visual Verification. This workflow is faster than returning to implementer for small, isolated, non-architectural issues (<30 min fixes).

### Evidence
Referenced observations:
- **Observation 11**: Self-fix workflow applied for design token violations
- **Observation 12**: Faster iteration than returning to implementer

### Impact Analysis
- **Time Saved**: ~15-20 minutes per small issue
- **Components Affected**: Development workflow
- **Severity**: medium
- **Blocking**: No

### Root Cause
Small issues (design token violations, missing RLS policies) can be fixed faster by the reviewer than by context-switching back to implementer.

### Recommended Action
Document self-fix guidelines: appropriate for <30 minute fixes, isolated issues, non-architectural changes

## Pattern 8: Explicit TypeScript Types Prevent Runtime Errors

**ID**: PAT-P6-KNOWLEDGE-001
**Category**: knowledge
**Type**: best_practice
**Frequency**: 1 occurrence
**Confidence**: 0.80

### Description
Explicit score dimension types (atsScore 0-30, keywordScore 0-25, etc.) instead of generic numbers enforce structure at compile time and prevent runtime errors.

### Evidence
Referenced observations:
- **Observation 13**: ScoreDimensions interface with explicit types

### Impact Analysis
- **Time Saved**: Prevents runtime errors during development
- **Components Affected**: TypeScript type system
- **Severity**: medium
- **Blocking**: No

### Root Cause
Type system can enforce business rules (score ranges, required fields) at compile time, catching errors before runtime.

### Recommended Action
Add to coding patterns: "Use granular types instead of generic primitives for domain-specific values"

---

## Pattern Relationships

**Pattern 2 → Pattern 3**: Both are quality gate issues caught by code review (design tokens, RLS policies)

**Pattern 4 → Pattern 3**: User ID denormalization is the solution that makes RLS policies performant

**Pattern 5 relates to Pattern 1**: Both emphasize simplicity over complexity (composition over configuration, simple algorithms over complex)

**Pattern 6 validates Pattern 7**: Successful knowledge transfer from Phase 5 proves learning system works

## Priority Rankings

### Must Address (Critical)
1. **Pattern 3: Incomplete RLS Policies** - Security issue, needs systematic prevention
