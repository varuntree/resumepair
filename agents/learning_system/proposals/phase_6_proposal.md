## Critical Updates (Must Apply)

These changes prevent blockers, fix security issues, or address recurring problems.

### 1. RLS Policy Completeness Checklist

**File**: `/ai_docs/coding_patterns.md`
**Section**: Database Migration Pattern
**Learning ID**: L-P6-003

**Why Critical**: Security issue. Missing DELETE policy caught in Phase 6 blocked merge. Without systematic checklist, easy to forget one of 4 CRUD operations.

**Current State**:
Migration pattern exists but lacks RLS policy checklist. Developers must remember all 4 policies manually.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
### ‚úÖ RLS Policy Completeness Checklist (Phase 6)

**For ALL user-scoped tables**, create these 4 CRUD policies:

```sql
-- Required RLS policies:
-- 1. SELECT: Read own data
CREATE POLICY "users_select_own" ON table_name
  FOR SELECT USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- 2. INSERT: Create own data
CREATE POLICY "users_insert_own" ON table_name
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- 3. UPDATE: Modify own data
CREATE POLICY "users_update_own" ON table_name
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (user_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- 4. DELETE: Remove own data
CREATE POLICY "users_delete_own" ON table_name
  FOR DELETE USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

**Critical**: Missing any of these 4 policies creates a security gap.
```

**Impact**: Prevents all future RLS security gaps
**Evidence**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-003, missing DELETE policy in migration 017

---

### 2. RLS Policy Review Checkpoint

**File**: `/ai_docs/standards/8_code_review_standards.md`
**Section**: Database Review Standards ‚Üí Database Checklist
**Learning ID**: L-P6-003

**Why Critical**: Enforcement mechanism for RLS completeness. Checklist without review checkpoint won't prevent issues.

**Current State**:
Database checklist exists but doesn't verify RLS policy completeness.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
### Database Checklist

- [ ] **Efficient Queries**
  - Only selects needed fields
  - Proper indexes used
  - No N+1 queries

- [ ] **RLS Policy Completeness (Phase 6)**
  - [ ] SELECT policy present
  - [ ] INSERT policy present
  - [ ] UPDATE policy present
  - [ ] DELETE policy present
  - All 4 CRUD operations covered for user-scoped tables

- [ ] **Migrations Are Safe**
```

**Impact**: Catches missing RLS policies before merge
**Evidence**: Phase 6 missing DELETE policy caught by code review

---

### 3. Design Token Compliance Check

**File**: `/ai_docs/standards/8_code_review_standards.md`
**Section**: Quick Review Checklist ‚Üí Code Quality Basics
**Learning ID**: L-P6-002

**Why Critical**: Recurring issue despite Phase 5 lessons. Hardcoded colors found in 2 Phase 6 components. Manual enforcement insufficient.

**Current State**:
Code quality checklist lacks design token verification.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
### Code Quality Basics
- [ ] **Clear naming** - Can another dev understand in 30 seconds?
- [ ] **No magic values** - All constants named
- [ ] **Single responsibility** - Each function/component does one thing
- [ ] **Design token compliance** - No hardcoded colors/spacing (Phase 6)
```

**Impact**: Prevents design token violations systematically
**Evidence**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-002, hardcoded colors in ScoreBreakdown.tsx and KeywordAnalysis.tsx

---

### 4. Design Token Violation Examples

**File**: `/ai_docs/standards/8_code_review_standards.md`
**Section**: Component Review Standards
**Learning ID**: L-P6-002

**Why Critical**: Concrete examples prevent violations. Developers need to see what's wrong and what's right.

**Current State**:
Design system check exists but lacks specific violation examples.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
### Design Token Violations (Phase 6)

**Common violations to catch**:

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Hardcoded Tailwind colors
<Badge className="bg-green-500 text-white">Good</Badge>
<div className="bg-gray-300">Content</div>
<span className="bg-green-100 text-green-800">Status</span>

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Design tokens via shadcn variants
<Badge variant="success">Good</Badge>
<div className="bg-muted">Content</div>
<Badge variant="outline">Status</Badge>

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Or use primary/secondary tokens
<Button className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground">Action</Button>
```

**Prevention**:
- Use shadcn/ui variants (success, outline, etc.)
- Create reusable variants in shadcn config
- Never use color-* or gray-* Tailwind classes directly
```

**Impact**: Clear examples make violations obvious in review
**Evidence**: Exact violations from Phase 6 components

---

## Recommended Updates (Should Apply)

These changes significantly improve efficiency, quality, or knowledge.

### 5. Simple Algorithms First Philosophy

**File**: `/ai_docs/development_decisions.md`
**Section**: Development Philosophy
**Learning ID**: L-P6-001

**Why Important**: Proven to save 4+ hours in Phase 6. Prevents over-engineering when performance requirements exist.

**Current State**:
Philosophy exists but lacks specific guidance on algorithmic complexity.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
## üéØ Development Philosophy (FIXED)
- **Target**: Indie hacker-style SaaS applications
- **Complexity**: Simple, functional implementations only
- **No Advanced Features**: No high security, analytics, high performance optimizations
- **Goal**: Fully functioning SaaS that works, not enterprise-grade solutions
- **Rule**: Keep it simple and get it working first
- **Performance**: Start with simple algorithms; optimize only when performance budgets are missed after measurement (Phase 6)
```

**Impact**: Saves 4+ hours per feature by avoiding premature optimization
**Evidence**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-001, simple keyword matching 5x faster than budget

---

### 6. User ID Denormalization Pattern

**File**: `/ai_docs/development_decisions.md`
**Section**: Database Setup
**Learning ID**: L-P6-004

**Why Important**: Standard pattern for all future child tables. Significant performance optimization for RLS.

**Current State**:
Database setup lacks RLS performance guidance.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup (FIXED)
- **Database**: Supabase only
- **Project Creation**: Done manually by developer (timing instructed by user)
- **Migration Creation**: Claude creates all migrations during development
- **Connection**: Database keys provided by developer when instructed by user
- **Rule**: Create migrations, connection timing depends on user instructions
- **RLS Performance**: Denormalize user_id in child tables for efficient RLS without joins (Phase 6)
```

**Impact**: Improves query performance for all user-scoped child tables
**Evidence**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-004, user_id in resume_scores despite being in resumes

---

### 7. Granular TypeScript Types

**File**: `/ai_docs/coding_patterns.md`
**Section**: TypeScript Strict Mode Patterns
**Learning ID**: L-P6-008

**Why Important**: Prevents runtime errors by enforcing business rules at compile time. Improves code quality.

**Current State**:
TypeScript strict mode section lacks guidance on domain-specific types.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
#### Domain-Specific Types (Phase 6)

**Rule**: Use granular types for domain values with business rules.

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Generic primitives
interface Score {
  dimensions: { [key: string]: number }
  total: number
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Explicit types with rules
interface ScoreDimensions {
  atsScore: number      // 0-30 points
  keywordScore: number  // 0-25 points
  contentScore: number  // 0-20 points
  formatScore: number   // 0-15 points
  completenessScore: number // 0-10 points
}

interface Score {
  dimensions: ScoreDimensions
  total: number // Sum of dimensions (0-100)
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Type system enforces structure
- Missing fields caught at compile time
- Business rules documented in types
- Better IDE autocomplete
```

**Impact**: Prevents runtime errors, improves code quality
**Evidence**: PAT-P6-KNOWLEDGE-001, ScoreDimensions interface

### 8. Component Composition Examples

**File**: `/ai_docs/coding_patterns.md`
**Section**: Component Pattern
**Learning ID**: L-P6-005

**Why Important**: Documents successful pattern from Phase 6. Helps future component design.

**Current State**:
Component pattern exists but lacks composition examples for complex features.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
### Component Composition for Complex Features (Phase 6)

**Pattern**: Break complex features into small, focused components.

**Example from Scoring Dashboard**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Monolithic component
<ScoreDashboard
  overallScore={85}
  atsScore={28}
  keywordScore={22}
  contentScore={18}
  formatScore={14}
  completenessScore={9}
  showBreakdown={true}
  showSuggestions={true}
  theme="default"
  // 20+ more props...
/>

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Composed components
<ScoreDashboard score={overallScore}>
  <ScoreRing value={atsScore} max={30} label="ATS" />
  <ScoreRing value={keywordScore} max={25} label="Keywords" />
  <ScoreBreakdown dimensions={dimensions} />
  <ScoreSuggestions items={suggestions} />
</ScoreDashboard>
```

**Benefits**:
- Each component <100 lines
- Single responsibility
- Easy to maintain and test
- Reusable in different contexts
```

**Impact**: Improves component design patterns
**Evidence**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-005, ScoreRing, ScoreDashboard, ScoreBreakdown components

---

## Optional Updates (Consider)

These are nice-to-have enhancements or process optimizations.

### 9. Self-Fix Workflow Documentation

**File**: `/ai_docs/coding_patterns.md`
**Section**: Code Review Checklist
**Learning ID**: L-P6-007

**Why Optional**: Process optimization, not critical path. Documents successful workflow discovery.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
### Self-Fix Workflow (Phase 6)

**When reviewer can fix directly** (<30 min, isolated, non-architectural):
- Design token violations
- Missing RLS policies
- Simple bug fixes
- Documentation updates

**When to return to implementer**:
- Architectural decisions needed
- Complex fixes requiring deep context
- Learning opportunity for implementer
- Fix might affect other code

**Workflow**: Implementer ‚Üí Code Review ‚Üí [Self-Fix Small Issues] ‚Üí Visual Verification

**Time saved**: 15-20 minutes per small issue vs context switching
```

**Impact**: Process optimization, faster iteration
**Evidence**: PAT-P6-PROCESS-002, self-fix workflow applied successfully

---

### 10. Component Composition Review Check

**File**: `/ai_docs/standards/8_code_review_standards.md`
**Section**: Component Review Standards
**Learning ID**: L-P6-005

**Why Optional**: Good pattern worth checking but not critical.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
### Component Composition (Phase 6)

**Check for proper composition**:
- [ ] Components <100 lines each
- [ ] Single responsibility per component
- [ ] Composition preferred over configuration
- [ ] Avoid monolithic components with 20+ props

**Red flag**: Component accepting >10 props often signals poor composition.
```

**Impact**: Encourages better component design
**Evidence**: PAT-P6-TECHNICAL-005, successful composition pattern

---

### 11. Knowledge Transfer Validation Note

**File**: `/ai_docs/standards/8_code_review_standards.md`
**Section**: Code Review Metrics
**Learning ID**: L-P6-006

**Why Optional**: Validates learning system effectiveness, not actionable guidance.

**Proposed Change**:
```markdown
### Learning System Validation (Phase 6)

**Track knowledge transfer effectiveness**:
- [ ] Errors from previous phases not repeated
- [ ] Documented patterns successfully applied
- [ ] First-try success rate improving

**Example**: Phase 6 had zero apiError parameter order mistakes after Phase 5 lesson - proves learning transfer works.
```

**Impact**: Validates learning system effectiveness
**Evidence**: PAT-P6-PROCESS-001, no parameter order errors

---
