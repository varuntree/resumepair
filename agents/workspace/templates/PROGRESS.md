# Template System Migration Progress

## Summary (Read first next session)
- Current session outcome: no new code mergedâ€”we reread every planning and research artifact in `agents/workspace/templates/**` (plans, runbook, dossiers) so the next run starts with full context despite the pause.
- Migration status remains mid-cutover: backend schema/store, per-page PDF pipeline, and 12 Reactive-Resume templates are in place, but exporter still falls back to single-buffer mode because `pdf-lib` is missing, and offline Google Fonts requests keep `npm run build` from succeeding.
- Highest-priority follow-ups: vendor/bundle `pdf-lib` for Node (`libs/exporters/pdfGenerator.ts:143`), swap Google Fonts to a local/offline-friendly strategy to unblock builds, run full manual smokes (template previews, PDF exports, typography/layout editor), and rehearse the Supabase migration scripts once credentials are available.
- Supporting materials ready to use next time: `MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md` for the database flow, `plans/0*.md` for phase-by-phase guidance, and `CURRENT_TEMPLATE_SYSTEM.md` / `SOURCE_TEMPLATE_SYSTEM.md` for architecture comparisons.
- Work is paused due to environment constraints (offline dependencies and pending credentials); resume with manual smokes once dependencies are addressed, then continue with staging migration.

## Executive Summary
We are replacing the existing four-template ResumePair system with the twelve-template Reactive-Resume architecture through five execution phases (foundation, PDF pipeline, template migration, fonts/layout customization, data migration/validation). This document tracks status, decisions, blockers, and next actions for the end-to-end effort.

## Milestones & Deliverables
1. **Phase 1 Completion** â€“ Schema updated, store adapters active, shared components ported, preview running on Tailwind & Phosphor. *(Target: TBD)*
2. **Phase 2 Completion** â€“ Per-page PDF exporter with instrumentation validated against sample resumes. *(Target: TBD)*
3. **Phase 3 Completion** â€“ All 12 templates available, catalog updated, previews/exports verified. *(Target: TBD)*
4. **Phase 4 Completion** â€“ Fonts metadata + layout editor shipped; customization persists and reflects in rendering. *(Target: TBD)*
5. **Phase 5 Completion** â€“ Migration/rollback scripts rehearsed on staging with backup procedures documented. *(Target: TBD)*
6. **Phase 6 Completion** â€“ Legacy deletion and documentation refresh complete; final QA sign-off obtained.

## Blockers & Assumptions
- PLAN_PATH assumed to be `agents/workspace/templates/plans/00_OVERVIEW.md`; confirm with stakeholders.
- Access to Supabase service-role credentials and staging environment is required before Phase 5; coordinate with platform team.
- Need confirmation on acceptable client bundle limits before importing Google Fonts metadata in Phase 4.

## Action Items
- [ ] Confirm PLAN_PATH assumption with project leads.
- [ ] Schedule staging environment window for migration rehearsal.
- [ ] Collect representative resume datasets (1â€“4 pages) for PDF benchmarking.
- [ ] Determine icon strategy (lucide replacements vs. vendored Phosphor) under offline constraints.
- [ ] Source offline bundle for `pdf-lib` or implement equivalent merge utility.

## Change Log
- **2025-10-08** â€“ Created progress tracker, initialized status table, logged initial assumptions and action items.
- **2025-10-08** â€“ Ported schema/store foundation and noted offline dependency constraints (fonts, icons).
- **2025-10-08** â€“ Refactored PDF exporter for per-page workflow with retry + logging; pdf-lib vendoring pending due to offline registry.
- **2025-10-08** â€“ Added 12 Reactive-Resume templates, font metadata/loader, and drag-drop layout editor.

## Update Guidance
- Update status row per phase when work starts/completes; include key notes or blockers.
- Append dated entries to the change log for each notable update or decision.
- Keep action items current; check off as resolved and add new ones as the project evolves.
- Record confirmations of assumptions in the Blockers & Assumptions section.
