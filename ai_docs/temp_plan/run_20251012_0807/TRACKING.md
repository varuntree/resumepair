# Overview
- Start time: 2025-10-12T08:07:30

# Part Logs
## Part 1 – Introduce AI Output Schema
- Implement → Added libs/validation/resume-ai.ts with permissive schema and documentation.
- Verify → npm run build (FAIL: dependent generator still references removed sanitizer path). Type-check deferred until generator replacement.
- Entropy detection → Build failure expected; micro-plan recorded in Part 2 to update generator references immediately.
- Rationale →
  - Keep schema responsibilities isolated.
  - Ensure flexible date parsing before generator rewrite.
  - Document single-flow intent proximal to schema.
- Diff summary → libs/validation/resume-ai.ts (new file).

## Part 2 – Replace AI Resume Generator
- Implement → Replaced libs/ai/resumeGenerator.ts with single-flow pipeline using ResumeAIOutput schema, default injectors, and manual repair fallback.
- Verify → npm run build (PASS), npm run lint (PASS), npm audit --production (FAIL: network blocked – will note in Decisions), type-check covered via build.
- Entropy detection → None observed after build; generator compiles cleanly.
- Rationale →
  - Structured outputs reduce duplicate sanitize/normalize steps.
  - Keep cover letter flow functional with existing normalizer.
  - Manual repair fallback trims JSON when provider slips.
- Diff summary → libs/ai/resumeGenerator.ts (full rewrite).
## Orientation
- Implement → Reviewed libs/ai/resumeGenerator.ts, libs/sanitization/resume.ts, app/api/v1/ai/unified/route.ts, scripts/manual/test-resume.ts to confirm touchpoints.
- Verify → N/A (orientation).
- Entropy detection → None; legacy sanitizer confirmed isolated.
- Rationale →
  - Identify exact imports to remove.
  - Confirm manual script path updates needed.
  - Validate docs location (ai_docs vs AI_docs).
- Diff summary → None (read-only).


# Quality
- Type-check: PASS (via npm run build)
- Build: PASS (npm run build)
- Lint/Format: PASS (npm run lint)
- Dependency audit: BLOCKED (npm audit requires network access)
- Manual smokes: BLOCKED (ts-node + dev server unavailable)

# Decisions
- Manual smoke Node script requires ts-node/loader; documented failure.
- API curl smokes need dev server; unavailable in CI sandbox.
- Dependency audit cannot reach registry (recorded; will re-run if connectivity restored)
- Manual repair fallback trims JSON substring because ai SDK does not export repairText

## Part 5 – Documentation & Dev Notes
- Implement → Added single-flow note to ai_docs/project/06_api.md; generator already documents new flow inline.
- Verify → npm run build (PASS), npm run lint (PASS); dependency audit remains pending.
- Entropy detection → None.
- Rationale →
  - Communicate removal of sanitize/normalize phases.
  - Keep reference docs aligned for future contributors.
  - Minimal change to avoid doc drift.
- Diff summary → ai_docs/project/06_api.md (note added).

## Part 6 – Cleanup & Consistency
- Implement → Updated agents/temp convenience plan with warning note, refreshed manual test script to use agents/temp/temp_resume.pdf and log usage, confirmed no residual sanitizer references.
- Verify → npm run build (PASS), npm run lint (PASS); dependency audit still offline.
- Entropy detection → None.
- Rationale →
  - Keep quick-reference docs aligned with new flow.
  - Ensure manual script exercises new warnings behavior.
  - Guarantee old sanitizer imports fully removed.
- Diff summary → agents/temp/PLAN_SINGLE_FLOW_MIGRATION.md, scripts/manual/test-resume.ts.

## Part 7 – Verification & Quality Gates
- Implement → Re-ran npm run build/npm run lint; attempted manual node script and curl smokes.
- Verify → npm run build (PASS), npm run lint (PASS); manual node script FAILED (TypeScript runtime requires ts-node), curl FAILED (dev server not running).
- Entropy detection → None beyond missed smokes; recorded assumptions.
- Rationale →
  - Ensure latest code path compiles cleanly.
  - Surface environment gaps (ts-node, running server) for follow-up.
  - Maintain audit trail of attempted smokes.
- Diff summary → No code changes in this part.

## Part 8 – Final Review & Documentation
- Implement → Completed review checklist, updated tracking quality notes, prepared final summary.
- Verify → Review checklist (all items checked), final lint/build passes referenced above.
- Entropy detection → None; final inspection shows expected diffs only.
- Rationale →
  - Ensure plan deliverables satisfied before exit.
  - Capture outstanding environment limitations.
  - Provide reproducible summary for reviewers.
- Diff summary → Documentation/metadata updates only.

# Done
- Summary: Replaced resume generator with single-flow Gemini structured output, added permissive AI schema, removed legacy sanitization, merged warnings in unified route, updated docs/scripts.
- Major decisions: Custom JSON repair fallback (ai SDK lacks repairText export); documented dependency audit/network and ts-node/server limitations.
- Legacy removed: libs/sanitization/resume.ts.
- How to run: npm run build && npm run lint (API smoke requires dev server; manual script needs ts-node or transpile support).
- Current commit: working tree (no commit).
