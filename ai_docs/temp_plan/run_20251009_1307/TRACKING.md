# Part Logs
## Part 1 — Baseline Verification
- Implement → Reviewed current preview renderer: confirmed 816px hardcoded width (`components/preview/PreviewContainer.tsx:33-47`), `Page.tsx` uses `minHeight` allowing overflow, zoom range limited to 0.5–1.5 (`stores/previewStore.ts:37-112`), and navigation lacks scroll binding (`PageNavigation.tsx`). Server PDF export currently succeeds in dry run; will still revalidate post-change.
- Verify → Baseline captured via code inspection; no automated run due to UI dependency.
- Entropy detection → None yet; baseline only.
- Rationale → Establish explicit before-state to compare after enforcing new sizing/zoom rules.
- Diff summary → No changes (baseline phase).

## Part 2 — Page Dimension Enforcement
- Implement → Updated `Page.tsx` to fix height at mm-derived value, added matching min/max height plus overflow clipping while retaining background/theme styles.
- Verify → To be completed after broader preview smoke (pending Part 9).
- Entropy detection → None observed; awaiting integration tests.
- Rationale → Enforces strict page bounds so sections cannot extend beyond the printable region.
- Diff summary → `libs/reactive-artboard/components/Page.tsx` (style adjustments).

## Part 3 — Preview Container Sizing
- Implement → Added shared page constants module, rewired `Page.tsx` and `PreviewContainer` to use canonical mm-to-px conversions and dynamic width/height; `LivePreview` and cover letter preview now pass format metadata.
- Verify → Awaiting manual preview smoke after remaining parts.
- Entropy detection → None spotted yet; monitor skeleton/default render width (now A4 by default).
- Rationale → Prevent horizontal clipping by aligning viewport sizing with selected paper format across preview contexts.
- Diff summary → `libs/reactive-artboard/constants/page.ts` (new), `libs/reactive-artboard/components/Page.tsx`, `components/preview/PreviewContainer.tsx`, `components/preview/LivePreview.tsx`, `components/preview/CoverLetterLivePreview.tsx`.

## Part 4 — Zoom System Upgrade
- Implement → Expanded preview store with 0.4–2.0 zoom range, fit-to-width mode, manual step/reset actions, and persisted last-manual zoom; enhanced `ZoomControl` with +/- buttons, fit toggle, reset, and additional presets; added keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl ±/0) plus drag-to-pan support when zoomed.
- Verify → Will exercise zoom presets, shortcuts, fit mode, and drag panning during manual smoke (Part 9).
- Entropy detection → Monitor for `ResizeObserver` availability and pointer capture behaviors during QA.
- Rationale → Provide modern document viewer ergonomics while keeping implementation dependency-free.
- Diff summary → `stores/previewStore.ts`, `components/preview/ZoomControl.tsx`, `components/preview/PreviewContainer.tsx`.

## Part 5 — Page Navigation & Layout Sync
- Implement → Added page metrics callback from `ArtboardFrame`, tracked offsets in previews, synced total page count through preview store, and wired container scroll logic to smooth-scroll on nav plus pan-aware drag and scroll-based page detection.
- Verify → Pending manual check of navigation buttons, scroll sync, and cover letter preview alignment.
- Entropy detection → Watch for environments without `ResizeObserver` or pointer capture causing nav glitches.
- Rationale → Keeps preview controls aligned with real layout and enables reliable multi-page navigation.
- Diff summary → `components/preview/ArtboardFrame.tsx`, `components/preview/LivePreview.tsx`, `components/preview/CoverLetterLivePreview.tsx`, `components/preview/PreviewContainer.tsx`, `stores/previewStore.ts`.

## Part 6 — Template Page-Break Semantics
- Implement → Applied `doc-avoid-break` to summary/section wrappers across all resume templates and cover letter, added utility definitions to artboard Tailwind source for iframe usage.
- Verify → To confirm during template preview smokes; ensure long sections stay intact per page.
- Entropy detection → Monitor for oversized sections that still exceed page height; follow-up if clipping observed.
- Rationale → Prevents mid-section splits during pagination and aligns iframe CSS with available utilities.
- Diff summary → Updated all templates in `libs/reactive-artboard/templates/*.tsx` and `libs/reactive-artboard/styles/tailwind.css`.

## Part 7 — Server Renderer Alignment
- Implement → Cross-checked `renderToHtml` registry usage; server path already instantiates templates with `{ columns, isFirstPage }` and consumes shared artboard store so no code changes required.
- Verify → PDF export smoke pending (Part 9/7C).
- Entropy detection → None; parity confirmed via code inspection.
- Rationale → Ensures exporter pipeline stays in sync with client rendering contract.
- Diff summary → No changes (verification-only).

## Part 8 — Tailwind/CSS Regeneration
- Implement → Ran `npm run artboard:css` to rebuild iframe stylesheet after adding break utilities; warning noted for Browserslist database refresh (requires network to update later).
- Verify → Confirmed generated bundle includes `.doc-avoid-break` token via ripgrep and `ArtboardFrame` continues referencing `/artboard/tailwind.css`.
- Entropy detection → None; regeneration touched only expected output file.
- Rationale → Ensures newly defined utilities are available inside isolated artboard runtime.
- Diff summary → `public/artboard/tailwind.css` (regenerated).

## Part 9 — Quality Gates & Manual Smoke
- Implement → Ran lint (pass), `npx tsc --noEmit` (fails due to existing exporter/template typing gaps), `npm run build` (fails offline fetching Google Fonts), audit pending due to restricted network.
- Verify → Manual UI/PDF smokes still outstanding; requires interactive environment and pdf-lib vendor fixes.
- Entropy detection → Captured existing failures for follow-up; no new regressions observed from latest changes.
- Rationale → Surface remaining blockers before resume template integration continues.
- Diff summary → No code changes (execution-only).

## Part 10 — Documentation & Tracking Updates
- Implement → Refreshed `agents/workspace/templates/PROGRESS.md` summary with latest preview fixes/blockers and maintained tracking artifacts.
- Verify → Docs rendered locally; ready for next session handoff.
- Entropy detection → None.
- Rationale → Ensure future sessions start with accurate status/context.
- Diff summary → `agents/workspace/templates/PROGRESS.md`.

# Quality
- Type-check: FAIL — exporter helper exports + template type-only imports missing (see /tmp/tsc.log)
- Build: FAIL — Next font loaders require network to fetch Google Fonts (see /tmp/build.log)
- Lint/Format: PASS
- Dependency audit: BLOCKED (network restricted)

# Decisions
- Orientation findings:
  - `libs/reactive-artboard/components/Page.tsx` still uses `minHeight`; enforcing fixed height remains required.
  - `components/preview/PreviewContainer.tsx` hardcodes Letter dimensions (816×11in), confirming need for dynamic sizing.
  - `stores/previewStore.ts` clamps zoom to 0.5–1.5 and lacks fit/keyboard support, matching plan assumptions.
  - `components/preview/PageNavigation.tsx` currently only updates store; no scroll binding observed.
  - Template registry/server renderer already pass `{ columns, isFirstPage }`; keep verification step but expect minimal change.

# Done
- Preview hardening complete (Parts 2–6,8): enforced fixed page sizing, dynamic preview metrics, zoom/navigation overhaul, template break utilities, Tailwind bundle regenerated.
- Outstanding to resume next session: pdf-lib bundling + exporter helper exports (blocks type-check), offline Google Fonts strategy (blocks build), PDF export smoke (Part 7C), manual preview/PDF QA (Part 9B).
