# 🎯 Agent Orchestration Plan: Resume Generation System Revamp

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Orchestrator**: Claude Code
**Status**: INITIATED

---

## **Mission Statement**

Completely revamp the resume generation system to eliminate the 30% cutoff issue by:
- Removing streaming complexity (use direct response)
- Simplifying schema (one definition, simple validation)
- Organizing code into clear layers
- Creating robust, maintainable architecture

---

## **Phase 1: Context Gathering**

**Agent**: `context-gatherer`
**Output**: `/ai_docs/temp_plan/01_context_analysis.md`
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

**Mission**: Deep investigation of current system to understand:
- Complete architecture and data flow
- All schema definitions and their locations
- Three input paths (editor, text, PDF)
- Logic organization issues
- Streaming complexity
- Root cause of 30% failure

**Expected Duration**: 10-15 minutes

---

## **Phase 2: Solution Planning**

**Agent**: `planner-architect`
**Output**: `/ai_docs/temp_plan/02_implementation_plan.md`
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING (waiting for Phase 1)

**Mission**: Design new simplified system with:
- New architecture (no streaming, clear layers)
- Simple schema design (one definition)
- Unified prompt strategy
- Clear code organization
- Complete implementation steps

**Research Required**:
- Gemini structured output best practices
- Schema design patterns
- Prompt engineering for resume extraction

**Expected Duration**: 15-20 minutes

---

## **Phase 3: Review & Decision**

**Orchestrator Review**
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING (waiting for Phase 2)

After both agents complete, orchestrator will:
1. Review both outputs for quality and completeness
2. Summarize findings and proposed solution
3. Identify any gaps or unclear points
4. Present to user for approval/feedback

## **Constraints & Non-Negotiables**

### **Keep (Cannot Change)**:
- ✅ PDF rendering/preview system
- ✅ Gemini 2.5 Flash AI model
- ✅ Vercel AI SDK
- ✅ Supabase backend
- ✅ Next.js framework

### **Remove**:
- ❌ Streaming implementation (streamObject)
- ❌ Scattered schema definitions
- ❌ Over-complicated validation (regex, unions, transforms)

### **Rewrite**:
- 🔄 API route implementation
- 🔄 Schema definition (single, simple)
- 🔄 Prompt engineering
- 🔄 Logic organization

---

## **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Generation completes 100% (all 10 resume sections)
- [ ] Works with any input combination (editor + text + PDF)
- [ ] No streaming complexity
- [ ] Schema defined once, used everywhere
- [ ] Code is organized and readable
- [ ] Errors are clear and actionable
- [ ] System is maintainable

---

## **Timeline**

- **Phase 1 (Context Gathering)**: ~15 min
- **Phase 2 (Planning)**: ~20 min
- **Phase 3 (Review)**: ~5 min
- **Total**: ~40 minutes
