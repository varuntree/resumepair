# Overview
- Start time: 2025-10-09T12:22Z
- PLAN_PATH: AI_docs/temp_plan/run_20251009_1220/PLAN.md
- Active run folder: AI_docs/temp_plan/run_20251009_1220
- Repo summary: Next.js app (`app/`, `components/`), libraries under `libs/` including `reactive-artboard/`, scripts in `scripts/`, public assets in `public/`, Tailwind config at root, docs in `AI_docs/`.
- Plan summary: Align artboard Tailwind + CSS variable contract with Reactive-Resume, regenerate styling bundle, update runtime metadata/types, document workflow.

# Checklists
## Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Audit source vs local Tailwind utilities
- [ ] 1.2 Align artboard Tailwind config with source
- [ ] 1.3 Regenerate `public/artboard/tailwind.css`
- [ ] 2.1 Emit complete variable set from `buildArtboardStyles`
- [ ] 2.2 Provide HSL-compatible color conversions
- [ ] 2.3 Sync metadata defaults with styling contract
- [ ] 2.4 Verify exporter/preview share contract
- [ ] 3.1 Fix template registry typing and resolve build errors
- [ ] 3.2 Document regeneration workflow & contract
- [ ] 3.3 Run quality gates and record smoke results

## Review
- [ ] Plan followed; all parts closed with evidence
- [ ] Quality gates (lint/type/build) documented as PASS
- [ ] Styling contract aligned; no legacy CSS artifacts left
- [ ] Types & docs updated; no TODO/FIXME remnants
- [ ] Manual smokes recorded (preview + PDF)
- [ ] Regeneration process reproducible and documented

# Heartbeats
2025-10-09T12:24Z • Phase2_Orientation • Reviewing artboard styling files → Catalog dependencies • Blockers: none
2025-10-09T12:46Z • Phase3_Execution • Finished Part 1/2 implementation, running quality gates next → Execute lint/tsc/build, prep manual smokes • Blockers: type-check missing pdfGenerator exports; build blocked by offline fonts

# Part Logs

## Part 1 — Tailwind Contract Alignment
- Implement → Audited artboard Tailwind contract: current `public/artboard/tailwind.css` lacked utilities like `p-custom` and `bg-primary`; root `tailwind.config.js` differed from source `apps/artboard/tailwind.config.js`. Added dedicated `tailwind.artboard.config.js`, broadened content globs, extended colors/spacing/line-height tokens, and added npm script `artboard:css`. Regenerated bundle via Tailwind CLI (see `npm run artboard:css`); new CSS includes `p-custom`, `text-background`, and other color utilities.
- Verify → Visual/manual verification pending (will confirm once CSS variables wired)
- Entropy detection → None (build command succeeded; Browserslist warning noted)
- Rationale → Templates require artboard-specific Tailwind tokens; recalibrated config ensures class generation matches Reactive-Resume reference.
- Diff summary → Added `tailwind.artboard.config.js`, updated `package.json` with `artboard:css` script, regenerated `public/artboard/tailwind.css`.

## Part 2 — CSS Variable Contract
- Implement → Updated `buildArtboardStyles` to emit artboard + Tailwind contracts: HSL-ready `--background`, `--primary`, etc., added `--margin`/`--line-height` tokens, and introduced helpers (`toHslComponents`, `mixColors`) to convert/derive values. Ensured resume & cover letter metadata coerce numeric margins for consistent spacing. Adjusted server renderer to mirror client layout iteration so templates receive `{ columns, isFirstPage }`.
- Verify → Code paths verified: both `ArtboardRenderer` (preview) and `renderToHtml` (exporter) consume updated variables and props; manual preview/PDF smoke still pending until fonts/pdf-lib blockers resolved.
- Entropy detection → None yet (compile pending)
- Rationale → Tailwind utilities consume CSS variables; aligning formats prevents invalid `hsl(#hex)` and missing spacing tokens; server renderer parity prevents runtime crashes in exporter.
- Diff summary → Modified `libs/reactive-artboard/styles.ts`, `libs/reactive-artboard/mappers/{resume,coverLetter}.ts`, `libs/reactive-artboard/server/renderToHtml.ts`.

## Part 3 — Type & Process Cleanup
- Implement → Swapped template registry typing to `TemplateProps`, updated `PROGRESS.md` summary with new Tailwind workflow + outstanding blockers.
- Verify → Lint passed; type-check/build blocked by existing pdfGenerator/export font issues (recorded under Quality). Manual preview/PDF smoke deferred until those blockers are resolved.
- Entropy detection → None yet
- Rationale → Keeps TypeScript accurate and documents the regeneration process for future runs.
- Diff summary → Modified `libs/reactive-artboard/templates/index.tsx`, `agents/workspace/templates/PROGRESS.md`.

# Quality
- Type-check: FAIL (`tsc --noEmit` → missing pdfGenerator exports; captured at /tmp/tsc.log)
- Build: FAIL (offline Google Fonts fetch during `npm run build`; see NextFontError output)
- Lint/Format: PASS (`npm run lint`)
- Dependency audit: Not run (would require network; pending)

# Decisions
- Adopted dedicated artboard Tailwind config with explicit regeneration command (`npm run artboard:css`) and enforced HSL variable contract in `buildArtboardStyles`.

# Done
