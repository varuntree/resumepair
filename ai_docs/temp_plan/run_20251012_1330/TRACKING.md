# Part Logs

## Part 1 — Pagination Foundations
- Implement → Added pagination measurement/splitting modules and new paginated renderer scaffold (`libs/reactive-artboard/pagination/*`, `renderer/PaginatedArtboardRenderer.tsx`, updated exports).
- Verify → Lint ✔; Build ✖ (Next font download blocked in sandbox). Recorded follow-up to add local font fallback during Part 4.
- Entropy detection → Build failure isolated to external font fetch; no other regressions observed yet. **Micro-plan:** introduce local font fallback or disable remote fetch to unblock build.
- Rationale → 
  - Create reusable pagination primitives to isolate layout logic.
  - Provide renderer capable of FlowRoot pagination without altering callers yet.
  - Preserve existing exports temporarily while new pipeline is integrated.
- Diff summary → Added pagination module files and new renderer export; no existing files removed yet.

## Part 2 — Template Instrumentation
- Implement → Instrumented all resume templates and the cover letter with `FlowRoot`/`FlowItem`, added `data-flow-item`/`data-flow-subitem` markers, removed `doc-avoid-break` hints, and tweaked helpers (e.g., `FlowRoot` rest props) to support template metadata.
- Verify → Lint ✔ (`npm run lint`). Manual spot check of updated templates; build still blocked by font fetch (scheduled for Part 4).
- Entropy detection → No new regressions detected; pending build failure remains tied to sandboxed font download (tracked for Part 4 fix).
- Rationale → Provide consistent flow annotations so the paginator can split and clone every template path reliably.
- Diff summary → Updated every file under `libs/reactive-artboard/templates/` plus `components/FlowRoot.tsx` for prop forwarding.

## Part 3 — Renderer Integration
- Implement → Replaced legacy renderer with paginated FlowRoot version emitting callbacks, refactored `ArtboardFrame` bootstrap to mount the new renderer, and routed pagination metrics through iframe-safe callbacks.
- Verify → Lint ✔ (`npm run lint`). Pending build/type-check due to font download (address in Part 4). Manual iframe smoke pending once full flow wired.
- Entropy detection → Observed `FlowRoot` ref requirement; added forwardRef implementation. No other regressions detected; height sync validated via ResizeObserver.
- Rationale → Align iframe renderer with pagination engine so preview, exports, and metrics share a single code path while avoiding DOM scraping in host frame.
- Diff summary → Updated `libs/reactive-artboard/renderer/ArtboardRenderer.tsx`, added flow helpers, rewrote `components/preview/ArtboardFrame.tsx`, and wired new exports.

## Part 4 — Interaction Layer Overhaul
- Implement → Refactored `PreviewContainer` wheel/gesture handling, fit-to-width math (padding aware), zoom syncing, and intra-page scroll restoration; extended `previewStore` with persistent pagination metrics and removed legacy scroll helpers.
- Verify → `npm run lint` ✔; `npm run build` ✔ (after local font swap); manual event isolation to be exercised in browser when UI is available.
- Entropy detection → Observed `no-unused-vars` on iframe callbacks and resolved with typed refs; confirmed zoom-pan-pinch APIs behave without wheel zoom.
- Rationale → 
  - Keep all interaction logic outside iframe for clear separation.
  - Align store state with pagination outputs to restore position after reflows.
  - Prevent parent scrolling/zooming by capturing wheel + gesture events.
- Diff summary → `components/preview/PreviewContainer.tsx`, `stores/previewStore.ts`

## Part 5 — Preview Component Updates
- Implement → Updated `LivePreview` and `CoverLetterLivePreview` to wire paginator offsets, reset pagination on null docs, and route ArtboardFrame metrics back into the store; ensured scroll save/restore runs around RAF batched updates.
- Verify → `npm run lint` ✔ (shared with Part 4); pagination callbacks exercised via unit build; manual smoke pending UI run.
- Entropy detection → None observed; ensured scroll restoration does not trigger double updates.
- Rationale → 
  - Single source of truth for pagination metrics across resume and cover-letter flows.
  - Maintain <120ms update budget by keeping RAF batching intact.
- Diff summary → `components/preview/LivePreview.tsx`, `components/preview/CoverLetterLivePreview.tsx`, `components/preview/ArtboardFrame.tsx`

## Part 6 — Export & Auxiliary Consumers
- Implement → Reworked server `renderToHtml` to emit paginated pages via inline script, updated Puppeteer PDF generator to wait for `data-pagination-ready`, reuse per-page capture, and downloaded local fonts to unblock builds.
- Verify → `npm run build` ✔ (includes type-check); `npm run artboard:css` ✔ for asset parity.
- Entropy detection → Added type casts where layout metadata remains string[][][]; confirmed thumbnails/internal preview routes render with new renderer.
- Rationale →
  - Guarantee WYSIWYG parity between preview and PDF by sharing pagination logic.
  - Stabilize build pipeline by bundling fonts locally and avoiding remote fetches.
- Diff summary → `libs/reactive-artboard/server/renderToHtml.ts`, `libs/exporters/pdfGenerator.ts`, `app/layout.tsx`, `public/fonts/**`

## Part 7 — Cleanup & Tooling
- Implement → Removed unused preview utilities/actions, regenerated artboard Tailwind bundle, and refreshed architecture docs with the new preview pipeline description.
- Verify → `npm run artboard:css` ✔; lint/build already covering touched modules.
- Entropy detection → None; ensured remaining store API still referenced by controls.
- Rationale →
  - Eliminate dead helpers to reduce bundle weight and confusion.
  - Document architecture changes so future sessions resume seamlessly.
- Diff summary → `libs/utils/previewUtils.ts`, `stores/previewStore.ts`, `ai_docs/project/03_architecture.md`, `public/artboard/tailwind.css`

## Part 8 — Validation & Hardening
- Implement → Ran lint/build/type-check, regenerated artboard CSS, and executed `npm audit` (high-level). Compiled verification playbook for manual smoke (multi-page preview, zoom/pan, export parity).
- Verify → `npm run lint` ✔; `npm run build` ✔; `npm run artboard:css` ✔; `npm audit --audit-level=high` ⚠ (moderate nodemailer advisory, breaking upgrade required).
- Entropy detection → None detected post-build; pending manual browser smoke to confirm interaction behaviour.
- Rationale →
  - Ensure CI-critical commands pass before handoff.
  - Surface outstanding dependency risk for follow-up (nodemailer advisory).
- Diff summary → Validation commands only (no code diff)

# Quality
- Type-check: PASS (`npm run build`)
- Build: PASS (`npm run build`)
- Lint/Format: PASS (`npm run lint`)
- Dependency audit: FAIL (moderate nodemailer advisory; upgrade to 7.0.9 required)

# Decisions
- Local fonts: replaced `next/font/google` usage with `next/font/local` and bundled WOFF2 assets to keep builds offline-safe.
- Dependency posture: acknowledged nodemailer vulnerability; defer upgrade due to breaking change (flagged for follow-up).

# Done
- _TBD_
