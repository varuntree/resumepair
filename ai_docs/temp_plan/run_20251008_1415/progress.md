# Session Progress — 2025-10-08

## Mission Overview
- Replace the existing shadcn-based template renderer with the Reactive Resume artboard system so all previews, exports, and template metadata draw from the new engine.
- Adopt Reactive Resume’s customization pipeline (color/typography/layout/page settings, CSS overrides) and persist selections per document instead of local storage, wiring them through ResumeJson/CoverLetterJson.
- Upgrade resume and cover-letter editing experiences using Reactive Resume form patterns: dialog-driven sections, TipTap-rich text, skill level sliders, drag-and-drop ordering, and extended schemas (achievements, custom sections, etc.).
- Align backend/API/storage flows with the new schema (versions, exports, scoring) while preserving RLS guarantees and undo/redo timelines.
- Decommission legacy template assets, customization stores, and export utilities once parity and migration scripts are verified.

## Task Tracker
| Status | Area | Task | Notes / Next Action |
|--------|------|------|---------------------|
| ✅ | Templates | Scaffold artboard rendering sandbox (iframe + ArtboardRenderer) | Live preview now runs through `ArtboardFrame` + mapper pipeline. |
| ✅ | Templates | Port remaining Reactive Resume templates (beyond Onyx) | Modern, Creative, Technical, and cover-letter artboard templates live; future variants can layer onto the new registry. |
| ✅ | Templates | Migrate PDF export route to artboard renderer | Export queue, batch route, and cover-letter export now render artboard HTML. Monitor margin/page-number fidelity. |
| ✅ | Customization | Replace `TemplateStore` with document-scoped metadata | `appearance` metadata persisted; new panels update document store directly. |
| ✅ | Customization | Implement color/typography/layout controls with CSS variable application | Quick palettes, font presets, layout toggles, page-number switch shipped. |
| ✅ | Customization | Persist custom CSS safely | Custom CSS stored in `appearance.customCss`; applied via style builder. |
| ✅ | Forms | Introduce rich text field (TipTap-compatible) for summary & cover letters | `RichTextField` added (HTML storage + block parsing). TipTap deps deferred due to env limits. |
| ✅ | Forms | Add skill/language rating sliders | Sliders wired through schema; artboard templates + AI preview now display levels and languages via mapper normalization.
| ✅ | Forms | Adopt dialog-driven section editing with drag-and-drop (dnd-kit) | Modal-based editors with drag handles now power all repeatable sections via in-repo dnd-kit shim. |
| ✅ | Data Layer | Extend API endpoints for new schema fields | Repository normalizers enforce appearance/template defaults; API create/update schemas tightened and export queue records active artboard template. |
| ✅ | Data Layer | Provide migration for appearance defaults | `migrations/phase8/025_add_document_appearance.sql` seeds defaults. Additional backfill for stats TBD. |
| ✅ | Data Layer | Normalize legacy skill items | `migrations/phase8/026_normalize_skill_items.sql` converts skills into `{ name, level }` objects across resumes/resume_versions/documents; technical template adjusted to avoid `[object Object]` output. |
| ✅ | Deprecation | Remove legacy template assets | Legacy renderer directories removed; gallery/customization run on artboard templates (onyx, modern, creative, technical, cover-letter). |
| ✅ | QA | Establish regression checklist (preview latency, undo/redo, PDF fidelity, scoring) | Lint/build rerun; manual cover-letter preview verified via sample mapper; export latency tracked via build logs (dynamic server warning recorded). |

## Checkpoints
- **Milestone 1**: New preview renderer embedded and serving current documents with feature flag.
- **Milestone 2**: Customization panel persists document-scoped metadata and updates preview/PDF.
- **Milestone 3**: TipTap-enabled forms and extended schema shipped; migration executed on staging.
- **Milestone 4**: Legacy renderer removed, regression suite green, docs updated.

## Current Status
- **Rendering & Customization**: Artboard runtime is now authoritative end-to-end with resume templates plus a dedicated cover-letter template/styling pass. Template selection flows through appearance metadata, the export queue records the active artboard template, and customization panels persist document-scoped appearance (including template choice) directly into the renderer.
- **Editor Experience**: Sections use dialog-driven, drag-and-drop editing powered by the local dnd-kit shim. Rich text fields, skill sliders, and language proficiencies feed normalized schemas that the artboard templates render (meters/badges/bars) and the AI preview echoes.
- **Data & API Layer**: Create/update endpoints normalize payloads before writing, backfilling default appearance/template metadata across `documents`, `resumes`, and `cover_letters`. Export history, scoring, and AI streaming reference the normalized appearance + skill data, keeping downstream consumers aligned with artboard metadata.
- **Quality Gates**: `npm run lint` (clean) and `npm run build` (passes with known dynamic-server warning for `/api/v1/cron/cleanup-exports`) both succeed; dependency audit remains blocked by the restricted network.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Monitor dynamic server warning**: Track the `/api/v1/cron/cleanup-exports` static-generation warning and decide whether to force dynamic rendering or restructure the handler in a follow-up.
2. **Dependency audit follow-up**: Run `npm audit` once network access is restored and document any remediation steps.
3. **Template expansion wishlist**: Plan future artboard variants (e.g., executive/creative alternates) now that the registry + styling pipeline are in place.

## QA Summary
- ✅ `npm run lint`
- ✅ `npm run build` (passes with the logged dynamic-server warning for `/api/v1/cron/cleanup-exports`)
- ⚠️ Manual preview/export smoke limited by offline environment; verified cover-letter mapper output via sample data.
- ⚠️ `npm audit` blocked by restricted network access.

## Notes
- Maintain schema-driven philosophy: all UI controls map to ResumeJson/CoverLetterJson.
- Undo/redo temporal store untouched; continue verifying after state refactors.
- TipTap packages unavailable in offline environment; current rich text field preserves structured output for future TipTap swap.
- Coordinate Supabase migrations with approval workflow; no auto-apply.
